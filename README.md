## Installation instructions

Having git installed:

First, you need to clone or download this project. To clone it, you just need to create a folder in your computer and then, execute the following code in your console:

### `git clone https://github.com/franrobles8/librarix-backend-nodejs-express.git`

Once you have done the step before, you need to install the required node modules that will allow you to run this project with all its dependencies. Before doing this step, make sure you have NodeJS in your machine. You can follow this instructions to install it: [View instructions](https://nodejs.dev/how-to-install-nodejs).<br>
Done that, you can install all the necessary modules by executing the next instruction in console:

### `npm install`

Now, you will need to run the node server to see the application:

### `npm start`

By default, it runs in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). That means all the api operations will need to be run on this port unless you change it explicitly in the code.

##### If you want to have a full application, you can install the frontend too following its documentation in the following link: [https://github.com/franrobles8/librarix-frontend-react-redux](https://github.com/franrobles8/librarix-frontend-react-redux)
